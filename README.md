## Credits
In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other places however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break up the credits section into Content and Media, depending on what you have included.

### Content
    - Example
    - Instruciton on how to x were taken from x
    - The icons in the footer were taken from Font Awesome (link not working?)

### Media

Images used were not copyright free as they needed to pertain to the 'DMDC', a fictional metal detecting club created for the TV show 'The Detectorists'. I also had great difficulty locating appropriate images via copyright free sites, so had to look elsewhere.
